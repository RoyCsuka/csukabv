            <h3>Goeiedag, Meneer Csuka.</h3>
            <p>On the left of this example, we have Franklin Gothic Bold paired with Souvenir. The basic feel of Franklin Gothic is stoic, sturdy, strong, but with a refined sense of elegance and mission. <a href="">It’s not a cuddly</a>, but functional. On the other hand, Souvenir is playful, casual, a little aloof, and very pretty. These two typefaces together come across like a Buckingham Palace guard who is dutifully ignoring a playful little girl at his feet trying to get him to smile. This kind of mixed-mood <strong>just doesn’t work very well</strong>. Mixing the mood of typefaces can draw attention to the typography instead of the message, which results in a poor design.</p>
