            <h2>Gekozen Fonts</h2>
            <h3>Goeiedag, Meneer Csuka.</h3>
            <p>On the left of this example, we have Franklin Gothic Bold paired with Souvenir. <strong>The basic feel of Franklin Gothic is stoic, sturdy, strong, but with a refined sense of elegance and mission.</strong> It’s not a cuddly, but functional. On the other hand, Souvenir is playful, casual, a little aloof, and very pretty.</p>
